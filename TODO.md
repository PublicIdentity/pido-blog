## Ideas

- importing blogrolls ([opml](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPML))
- integration with OpenStreetMap [data](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Downloading_data) for locations
- auth with phone numbers?
- have a "last updated" for each identity.
	- store etag/md5sum/last-modified header/last-modified element
	- how to update?
