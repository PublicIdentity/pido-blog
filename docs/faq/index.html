title: FAQ
faq:
    - q: What is this?
      a: |
        A search engine for people and organizations.

    - q: Why?
      a: |
        With the advent of the Fediverse and the proliferation of places where people
        are posting, it is difficult to find someone.

    - q: How?
      a: |
        For the initial version, I am loading seed data from various sources and creating a search engine.
        Longer term, people will be able to login and create/update their own profiles.  And delete them, if
        they don't want to be found.

    - q: How will it complete with `$BIGCOMPANY` ?
      a: |
        * The social neworks (Facebook, Twitter et al) don't want you to search for people
        outside their walled gardens.
        * Google is too big and too full of noise.  And too hard to update.
        * The Fediverse is fragmented (by design!) and doesn't have a unified search.

        I am doing [blog posts comparing](/blog/tags.html?tag=comparison) PIDO with various comparable companies/projects/etc.

    - q: Isn't this a privacy nightmare?
      a: |
        This is specifically focused on *public* identities.  It is right there in the name!

        I do not want to expose private information: I am only loading the seed data from publicly available sources, I hope to transition to a model where people create their
        own profiles.

    - q: Can I opt-out?
      a: |
        Absolutely!  One of the first features will be a way for you to hide or delete your profile.  For the moment, you need to [contact me](/contact.html).

    - q: Where does the data come from?
      a: |
        I will be blogging as I load data from various sources.

    - q: Who is behind this?
      a: |
        Just [me](https://andrew.marcuse.info/) at the moment.  I would love some help though!

    - q: What does PIDO stand for?
      a: |
        Public Identity Dot Org.  I am too lazy to type it out every time.

    - q: Why is the icon a pie?
      a: |
        "PIDO" is a homophone for "pie dough".

    - q: What is the technology stack?
      a: |
        For this website, see the [Credits](https://github.com/VectorLogoZone/pido#credits) section of the README.

        I plan on having separate repositories for the other pieces of the project, which will have their own tech stacks
        and be documented in their respective READMEs.

    - q: Why a proprietary license?
      a: |
        This website has my ideas and opinions.  You are entitled to your own but you will have to come up with them yourself.

        My current plan for the other parts of the project is to have either a completely open source or dual-license.
