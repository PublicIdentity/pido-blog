I want to have enough data to be useful, but I don't want to have to maintain/update it.

I am under no illusions that people will update their own data, so I will not store things that are likely to change.

Open question: should there be a specific page per identity?  Versus just having the search results page with all the information.  If there is a specific page, what should the URL be?  I will do a separate post about having handles (and possibly monetizing them).

Examples:
* Root website only: specific pages (i.e. contact page, location, etc) move too often
* No detailed addresses: only country.  Maybe city?
