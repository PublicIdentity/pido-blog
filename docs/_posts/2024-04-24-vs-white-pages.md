In the days before the internet, we used [phone books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_directory)
to find the phone number of someone we wanted to call.

## Advantages

* The list included every phone number for the given area.
* Opt-out was monetized: you could pay for an [unlisted number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unlisted_number).
* There wasn't any advertising, but you could pay to have your name in **bold**.

## Disadvantages

* Each phone book only included numbers for a given area.
* Areas with a lot of people had huge phonebooks.
* Areas with a lot of people has a lot of duplicate names.  They used address to help disambiguate, which is not currently desirable from a privacy standpoint.
* It was run by the phone company and only included people with phones.

## Notes

This is directly comparable to what I want to build.  I wouldn't monetize opt-out, maybe I could charge for a **bold** listing.
