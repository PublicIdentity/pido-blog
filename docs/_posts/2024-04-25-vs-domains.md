Domain names are a key part of how the internet works.

## Advantages

* They are easily recognized and used.
* They are public (by design).
* Most identities that are big enough have a website and thus a domain name.
* Generally speaking, you need to pay for a domain name, so there are some limits to spam.
* List of registered domain names are [available](https://czds.icann.org/home).

## Disadvantages

* Not everyone has their own website.
* Not everyone has a top-level domain: Mozilla maintains a [public suffix list](https://publicsuffix.org/) of top-level domains that allow unrelated identities under them.  Some of these allow free registration and are prone to spam.
* There are a lot of [unused domains](https://ccampbell.io/posts/10-percent-of-top-million-sites-are-dead/).
* The `whois` service shows who owns a domain, but is so heavily redacted that it is not useful.

## Notes



As of 2024-04-24, there are about 379 million domain names ([source](https://www.netmeister.org/tldstats/)).

I do not think domain names can be used for seeding identities.
