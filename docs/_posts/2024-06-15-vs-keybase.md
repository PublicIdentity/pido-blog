h1: Comparing PublicIdentity.org with Keybase
tags: [ comparison, seed, proofs ]

[Keybase.io](https://keybase.io/) is a service/website focused on private communication/sharing based on public/private key shared.

Part of the service is claiming identities at various services.

## Advantages

* Ties multiple identities together is a secure and auditable way.
* APIs to get and verify identities.
* Profiles are not blocked by robots.txt and show up in Google searches.
* Website has working search functionality.

## Disadvantages

* Requires a fair amount of technical knowledge.
* Wants to install a client app.
* [Acquired by Zoom](https://keybase.io/blog/keybase-joins-zoom) in May 2020 and has been very quiet since then.
* At one point they had a way to add a new service to the list of places where you could verify, but the documentation link is no longer valid.

## Notes

Despite the Zoom takeover, the servers are still running, and the identities/proofs can still be found and validated, so I think it will be a useful as a seed data source.

* [Keybase Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keybase) says there are 407,163 registered users as of 2019-08-22 but does not indicate the source.
* [2019-04-15 HN Discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19668531) when they started supporting Mastodon verifications.
* [Verification suggestions Github issue](https://github.com/keybase/keybase-issues/issues/518)
* [Keyoxide.org](https://keyoxide.org/) is a possible alternative/replacement.
