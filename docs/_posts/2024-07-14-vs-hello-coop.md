title: Hellō.coop Comparison
h1: Comparing PublicIdentity.org with Hellō.coop
tags: [ comparison ]

I am planning to use [Hellō.coop](https://www.hello.coop/) for authentication, but they can also be seen as a competitor.

## Similarties

* Verified identities
* Verified links to identities at various services

## Differences

* PIDO will have unverified identities (presumably marked as such)
* PIDO will have identities that are added/verified by admins
* PIDO will have identities for organizations.
* Hellō is going to monetize via paid validation.

## Summary

Hellō is focused on verification while PIDO is focused on completeness.  I think the differences are enough that I don't have to worry about them cutting off PIDO.

It would be awesome if I could get Hellō to add a "make my identity public" checkbox that publishes to PIDO.
