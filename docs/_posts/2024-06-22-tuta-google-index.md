[Tuta](https://www.tuta.com) is a privacy-focused email provider and direct competitor to GMail.

In April 2024, Google [deindexed Tuta](https://tuta.com/blog/google-search-problem) from generic email-related terms.  In June 2024, Tuta was [back in the results](https://tuta.com/blog/unchecked-power-of-google).

Tuta has complained [Google has a monopoly on search](https://tuta.com/blog/google-search-monopoly), and (IMHO) they are correct.  I understand that Google doesn't want to share its algorithms with spammers, but it has a responsibility to provide a fair and unbiased results.  When the results are (to an outside
obsever) blatently anti-competitive, it should (at least privately) explain what is going on.

I don't think that I'll ever get to the point of being a monopoly, but in any case, I plan on being fully transparent.  External signals (and paid listings) will be noted and auditable.
