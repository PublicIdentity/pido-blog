[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) is an excellent resource for finding people.

## Advantages

* The data has been manually verified.
* The [infobox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infobox) usually has all the relevant links.
* Lots of people use it, so it (hopefully) is up to date.

## Disadvantages

* You need to be ["Notable"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability).  This limits Wikipedia to only the most well-known people.
* The identity is owned by Wikipedia.  Wikipedia editors can change or block your updates.
* Other people can make updates (which can be an advantage)
* Not every article has an infobox.
* There are multiple types of infoboxes.

## Sizing

As of 2024-04-23, the English Wikipedia has 6.8 million articles (from [Wikipedia:Size_of_Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Size_of_Wikipedia)).

This page also has a graph that shows the English Wikipedia is about 10% of the total, but much of that is auto-generated translations, and there will be duplicates even if it isn't.  Wild guess: English is 25% of the total, so maybe 30 million articles.

Future research needed: How many pages have infoboxes.  And which types of infoboxes?

## Notes

I plan to use Wikipedia to seed the PIDO identity database.

Useful links:

* [List of infoboxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:List_of_infoboxes) - there are (unfortunately) a lot of different flavors of infoboxes.
