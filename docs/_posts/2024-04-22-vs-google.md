Google is the 800 pound gorilla for anything involving search, including identities.

## Advantages

* They have indexed the entire public internet: so chances are that they know about you.

## Disadvantages

* They have indexed the entire public internet, so there is a lot of junk and noise.  Your identity may not be in the top results.
* They can't index identities if the GoogleBot isn't allowed in, so many social network identities will not be indexed even if they are public.
* Their update algorithms are opaque and usually have a delay.

## Notes

They have several different services that have profiles.  Future posts will dive into each one.
